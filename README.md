Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the canvas.

How to Play
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
Guide the snake to eat the red food squares that appear on the screen.
The snake will grow longer each time it eats food.
Avoid colliding with the snake's own body or the edges of the canvas.

Files
index.html: HTML file containing the structure of the web page and the canvas element where the game is displayed.
style.css: CSS file containing styles for the game area.
script.js: JavaScript file containing the game logic, including the movement of the snake, generation of food, and collision detection.

Game Mechanics
The snake moves continuously in the direction specified by the player's arrow key inputs.
The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
Food appears randomly on the canvas.
If the snake collides with itself or the canvas boundaries, the game ends.
The game speed increases over time, making it more challenging.

Customization
You can customize the game by modifying parameters such as the size of the canvas (canvasSize), the speed of the snake (snakeSpeed), and the size of the snake segments (box) in the script.js file.
